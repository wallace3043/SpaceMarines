# SpaceMarines
XCOM-clone. Turn-based squad-tactics game

Requires the Allegro 5 library for C++.
Use the mouse and/or keyboard to control a team of 6 space marines to defeat the invading alien force.
  - The assault class specializes in close range combat, and has an accuracy penalty for long distances.
  - The sniper class is the opposite, and suffers in accuracy the closer they are to the target.
  - The heavy class has great damage, but limited movement points.
  - The support class has medium damage and range, and extensive movement points.
Both the aliens and the space marines benefit from a "half-cover/full-cover" system, much like the one in XCOM.

Good Luck, Commander.
